## Probes and one-shot scripts: run locally by default

When a task is a pure-compute probe or one-shot diagnostic that could be
done either by (a) pushing a GitHub Actions workflow + waiting for Rob to
dispatch and paste the log back, or (b) running directly in this sandbox
with `python3` / `requests` / etc. — **default to (b)**.

Only push an Actions workflow when the target genuinely requires a GH
runner:

- IP-allowlisted edges (Sedo's CDN returns `403 "Host not in allowlist"`
  to this sandbox; GH runners are on the allowlist)
- Cloudflare-protected endpoints that need scrape.do (Oxley, NameJet,
  Dropcatch)
- Workflows that need GitHub Secrets we don't have locally
- Anything that should run on a recurring cron

For everything else — Sheets reads, Spaceship/Atom/Namecheap APIs,
Supabase queries, Drive ops, pipeline CLI commands — execute it here and
report the result. No round-trip, no dispatch link, no copy/paste.
